    "Simplicity: It keeps things neat and tidy, making the code less complex.\n",

    "\n",
    "Attributes and methods are accessible from anywhere, both within and outside the class.\n",

    "Private Access Modifier:\n",

    "Attributes and methods are not directly accessible from outside the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Protected Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes and methods are accessible within the class and its subclasses (inheritance).\n",
    "Typically indicated by a single underscore before the attribute or method name.\n",
    "It provides a middle ground between public and private, allowing for selective access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance in Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public: Inherited by subclasses. The subclass can freely access and modify public members of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private: Private members are not inherited. They are encapsulated within the class, not exposed to the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected: Shared with subclasses, allowing them to access and potentially modify these members. It facilitates the reuse of code and promotes a certain level of visibility within the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the protected access modifier serves as a bridge between public and private, enabling a controlled level of access within the class hierarchy. It allows for the benefits of inheritance while maintaining some encapsulation of implementation details."
