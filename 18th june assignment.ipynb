    "\n",
    "Differences between logging and print statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Output Destination:\n",
    "\n",
    "* print: Outputs messages to the console by default. It's primarily for debugging purposes and doesn't provide structured logging capabilities.\n",
    "* logging: Allows flexible output destinations, including the console, files, remote servers, etc. It supports different log levels and provides more control over where log messages are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Log Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "* print: Doesn't have built-in log levels. All messages are treated equally.\n",
    "* logging: Provides log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize messages based on their severity. This allows for selective filtering and handling of different types of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* print: Limited formatting options. Generally, it prints the values of objects or expressions.\n",
    "* logging: Supports advanced formatting through formatters, allowing customization of the log message format, including timestamps, log levels, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Structured Logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* print: Outputs unstructured text. It can be challenging to parse and analyze programmatically.\n",
    "* logging: Facilitates structured logging, making it easier to extract information from log messages in a consistent manner. This is particularly useful for log analysis and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* print: Doesn't provide built-in error handling for logging failures.\n",
    "* logging: Can be configured to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that critical log messages are not lost even if there's an issue with the logging system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use logging over print in a real-world application:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Production Environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use logging in production environments for systematic logging, monitoring, and debugging. It provides a more robust and configurable logging infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use print statements during development and debugging for quick and simple output to the console. However, consider replacing them with logging when the application becomes more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selective Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * logging allows you to control the verbosity of log messages through log levels. This is valuable when you want to output more detailed information during debugging but reduce verbosity in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analysis and Monitoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * logging supports structured logging, making it easier to extract information for analysis and monitoring tools. This can be crucial in large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * logging provides better error handling capabilities, ensuring that critical log messages are not lost in case of failures in the logging system.\n",
